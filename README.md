```

Explanation of the directory structure:

- `backend/`: Contains the backend code and configuration files.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the backend application.
  - `models/`: Directory for storing the language model related code.
    - `language_model.py`: Python code for configuring and interacting with the language model (LLM).
  - `data/`: Directory for storing the client intake documents.
    - `category_assessment.md`: Markdown file containing the content of the "Client Intake: Category Assessment" document.
    - `category_questionnaire.md`: Markdown file containing the content of the "Client Intake: Category Questionnaire" document.
  - `utils/`: Directory for utility code and helper functions.
    - `tokenization.py`: Python code for tokenizing and preprocessing text inputs.

- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend code and related files.

This directory structure separates the backend and frontend code, allowing for easier management and organization of the project. The backend code handles the interaction with the LLM and data storage, while the frontend code focuses on rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
You can further extend this structure as per your project requirements, adding additional directories for tests, deployment configuration, or any other specific components or functionalities you plan to include.
Remember to adapt the directory structure according to your specific project needs and conventions, but the suggested structure should provide a solid foundation for your GitHub repository.
